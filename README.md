## ⚠️ Note on API Usage

This project uses an unofficial, undocumented API endpoint from Google Translate (`translate.googleapis.com`). This endpoint is not intended for production use and may be subject to rate-limiting, breaking changes, or discontinuation by Google at any time. For production applications, it is highly recommended to use the official Google Cloud Translation API.
